/// Probe whether an Apple Metal device is available and functional.
///
/// This is implemented by attempting to create a `candle_core::Device::Metal`
/// using `Device::new_metal(0)`.  The Metal framework is part of macOS and
/// is always present on supported hardware; the probe will only fail on
/// headless CI environments or very old hardware that pre-dates Metal support
/// (pre-2012 Macs).
///
/// The backend shared library links against the Metal framework at compile
/// time (`candle-core` with the `metal` feature), so this plugin can only
/// be built on macOS.  On all other platforms the probe immediately returns
/// non-zero.
///
/// Returns 0 if `Device::new_metal(0)` succeeds, 1 otherwise.
